# PLEASE NOTE: this solution finds the first number that meets conditions:
# 1) Pj - Pk is pentagonal
# 2) Pj + Pk is pentagonal

# first found solution happens to also meet the third condition:
# 3)  D = |Pk âˆ’ Pj| is minimised

# why?   
#  P(2)-P(1) = 4
#  P(3)-P(2) = 7
#  P(4)-P(3) = 10 
# so P(n)-P(n-1) < P(n+1)-P(n) < P(n+2)-P(n+1) ...
# This means the difference between adjacent terms is increasing. And also, for the nth term, the minimum D, even without the condition, will be
